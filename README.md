# predicting-Paid-amount-for-Claims-Data
Medical claims file for 2016 contains ~17 millions rows and ~60 columns of data, containing ~6.5 million individual medical claims. These claims are all commercial claims that were filed by healthcare providers in 2016 in the state of NH. These claims were ~88% for residents of NH and the remaining for out of state visitors who sought care in NH. Each claim consists of one or more line items, each indicating a procedure done during the doctor’s visit. Two columns indicating Billed amount and the Paid amount for the care provided, are of primary interest. The main objective is to predict “Paid amount per procedure” by mapping a plethora of features available in the dataset
